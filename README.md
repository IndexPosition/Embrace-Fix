# TATA Embrace Redirect Fix

A simple **Tampermonkey userscript** that prevents TATA Embrace from auto-redirecting to Lite, allowing you to load and use the Embrace site. LOL that rhymes!

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (or another userscript manager) in your browser. If you're unsure, watch the tutorial!
2. Create a **new userscript** in Tampermonkey.
3. Copy-paste the script into the editor. :)
4. Save the script and make sure it’s enabled.

## How to use it
1. Set Network Throttling to 3G (This helps with loading the page before redirecting only without the throttle, it was not working.)
  - Open DevTools → Go to Network Tab → Select Slow 3G.
2. Copy the Embrace link with your damn UserID manually (Because it is not 100% accurate! And will require you to copy and paste the link, but trust me, it will work)
3. Paste the link back in the address bar and press Enter.
  - If it redirects to Lite, repeat the step once or twice.
  - If it is still redirecting, then decrease the delay, and increase it if it's displaying a blank page. We need to be in the grey line.
4. Once you have done like 60% of the progress, you will eventually never get redirected back, so you can then disable the script and work normally (which probably means in the Lite, there was something that never got updated even after completing, so it redirects us back).

## That's it
1. If it was useful for you, then please consider giving me a **star** so that I can flex :P
2. This is the script only meant for personal use, just to complete the course. It is not associated with TCS at all.
3. Also if you have any improvement ideas, lemme know as I would do that.
4. Also let me know if you want a tutorial, I might make some GIF or something to show how to do stuff.
